# DEV262 - Full Lifecycle API Platform

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2020 session called DEV262 - Full Lifecycle API Platform 

## Overview

As enterprises depend on APIs for integration between SAP and non-SAP data sources, it's necessary to think hard about how to govern the consumption of these services. BestRun AG is a fictitious company that is looking at new ways to collaborate and co-innovate with their partners & application developers. This company is a global player with several subsidiaries and locations world-wide selling its products through direct distribution channels. BestRun AG has a heterogenous landscape with data stored in non-SAP CRM, custom integration flows and microservices built by their line of businesses and IT team. They are using SAP system to store the information about their products, sales orders, purchase orders. Their sales and marketing team are using a non-SAP CRM system to maintain information about their customers, customer address, phone numbers and opportunities

BestRun AG want to open their business processes and data from their business systems with their partners and suppliers in secured and controlled manner. They would like to make it easier for their new partners to on-board themselves, try out their APIs in a self-service manner and use these APIs to integrate the partner data with BestRun AG. They also would like to foster an API program for their internal employees to discover, explore and consume their APIs to build modern digital applications like chatbots, mobile applications and custom analytics dashboard combining data from their SAP and non-SAP sources. To achieve this, BestRun AG needs to decouple the complexity of their backend system, from their developers, who will be using these APIs to develop their applications.
